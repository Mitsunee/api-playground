# api-playground

This repository is currently getting rewriten. Consider all the APIs unstable for now :)

## Todo

- **cache age**: Minimum amount of time that needs to pass before rechecking info
- probably some way to point at the timestamp of api info
- is there a way to put data into the user's clipboard?
- finish porting make-servant.js
- update package.json scripts?
- port skipped scripts
