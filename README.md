# api-playground - personal branch

This branch serves as a backup for my own scripts using the Atlas Academy Game Data API.

The 'scripts' directory contains some example scripts I keep around for editing as well as a 'helpers' directory with small modules to make scripts easier to write. The 'fgo-spreadsheet' directory contains scripts I use to update my material tracking spreadsheet.

See 'main' branch for documentation on this respository.
